   *
   * ── Why this has to exist ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * React Native 0.78 handles back by overriding the DEPRECATED
   * Activity.onBackPressed(). Nothing in the React Native AAR registers an
   * OnBackPressedCallback.
   *
   * This app targets SDK 36, and from Android 16 the platform no longer calls
   * onBackPressed() — back is delivered through OnBackInvokedDispatcher, which
   * androidx forwards to onBackPressedDispatcher. With no callback registered
   * there, the dispatcher falls through to its default and FINISHES THE
   * ACTIVITY. The press never reached JavaScript, so every screen exited the app
   * instead of navigating back, and no amount of BackHandler work in JS could
   * have caught it — BackHandler was never being called.
   *
   * Registering here restores the delivery path. It is deliberately not gated on
   * an API level: on older devices the legacy onBackPressed() override inside
   * ReactActivity consumes the press before the dispatcher is ever consulted, so
   * this callback simply does not fire and behaviour is unchanged.

  /**
   * Lays the window out edge-to-edge, and NOTHING else. In particular it hides
   * no system bar: whatever the device is set to — three buttons or a gesture
   * pill — stays on screen, and the status bar belongs to the app's own Hide
   * Status Bar setting.
   *
   * This method used to hide `Type.systemBars()` and then, briefly,
   * `Type.navigationBars()`. Both were wrong, for different reasons.
   *
   * Hiding `systemBars()` took the status bar with it, which is what made the
   * Hide Status Bar setting look broken: React Native's StatusBar showed the
   * bar as the user asked and the next focus change hid it again a moment
   * later.
   *
   * Hiding `navigationBars()` alone fixed that but kept the worse half. There
   * is one inset type for the navigation bar whichever way the device draws it,
   * so hiding it took the BUTTONS from anyone on three-button navigation — back,
   * home and recents gone, reachable only by swiping up first, and re-hidden on
   * every focus change. A gesture user lost a cosmetic pill; a button user lost
   * the ability to leave the app. There was no setting for it either way.
   *
   * Nothing in the app has to change to accommodate the bar. Its own chrome is
   * already written against the bottom inset — `BottomNavigation` wraps itself
   * in a bottom-edge `SafeArea`, and the Reader lifts the audio player and its
   * progress track by `insets.bottom` — and that code has simply been resolving
   * to zero for as long as the bar was hidden. Edge-to-edge stays on, so those
   * are still the things deciding where the app's own bars sit; they now sit
   * above a bar that is really there.
   *
   * Re-applied on focus rather than set once in `onCreate` because React
   * Native's StatusBar owns the status bar: showing it runs
   * `Window.statusBarShow()`, which calls `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(TRUE)` and
   * resets the cutout mode, quietly taking the window out of edge-to-edge the
   * first time anyone turns Hide Status Bar off.
