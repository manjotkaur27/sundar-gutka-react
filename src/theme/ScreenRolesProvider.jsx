// Applies one screen's colours to a whole subtree.

// The alternative is a colour prop on every primitive the subtree contains —
// `Row` taking a divider colour, `Text` taking a title colour, the checkmark
// taking its own — which is exactly the inline overriding the token layer
// exists to remove. Here a screen declares WHICH palette its subtree is on, and
// `useTokens` resolves the same role names to that palette's values, so the
// primitives inside need no change at all.
//
// This is the seam a user-selectable theme drops into later: a theme swaps what
// `rolesFor` returns, and every subtree already asking for its screen's roles
// follows automatically.
//
// The default is null — no override — so a component outside a provider reads
// the semantic layer exactly as before.
