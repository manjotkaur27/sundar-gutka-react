// read ~80 one-off keys — `sectionBg`, `flameBg`, `vaakTabActiveBg`,
// `switchOnTrack` — through `paletteFor()`, which is keyed by light/dark and so
// cannot see a theme at all. Overriding `theme.c` therefore reached neither
// screen, which is why they stayed navy under Puratan.
//
// So each key is mapped to a role by hand, grouped by what it IS. Grouping
// rather than one mapping per key keeps this readable at 80 entries and makes
// an unclassified key obvious — `screenPalette.test.js` fails on any colour key
// that appears in no group, so a key added to screenPalettes.js later cannot
