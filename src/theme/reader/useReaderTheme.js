/**
 * The single entry point for reading-theme values.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   theme        the resolved record (never null)
 *   selectedId   the stored setting, so Settings can mark the right tile
 *   isDesigned   whether that setting is a designed theme rather than a plain
 *                Default/Light/Dark appearance
 *
 * There is ONE setting behind this — `state.theme`. When it names a designed
 * theme, ThemeProvider has already put the app into that theme's paired
 * appearance, so `appTheme.mode` below agrees with the record by construction.
 * When it does not, the Reader follows the app exactly as it always has.
