// destroys it: mixing a parchment toward white desaturates the parchment, so
// Puratan's player came out near-white on a cream page and stopped looking like

// Everything a reading theme can work out for itself.
//
// A designed theme declares FIVE colours and nothing else has to be written:
//
//   ground   the page
//   ink      the Gurbani
//   accent   headings, transliteration's parent tone, the player, the nav bar
//   muted    (optional) secondary ink — transliteration, teeka, muted labels
//   rule     (optional) frames, dividers, separators
//
// From those, this file produces every semantic slot in the schema: the four
// text roles, the sync-scroll wash, the scrollbar, the reader chrome, the whole
// audio player, and the bottom navigation. That is ~40 values from 5.
//
// It exists because the alternative is what the first cut of these themes looked
// like: Puratan spelled its accent SIX times across its own file, three as
// "#6B2020" and three as "rgba(107, 32, 32, …)". Changing one colour meant
// finding every spelling by hand with nothing to catch a miss.
//
// EVERY slot below is still overridable — the merge order in schema.js is
// base -> derived -> the theme's own record, so a theme states only where it
// disagrees. Puratan's two-rule frame and White's larger font scale are exactly
// that: a few lines of deliberate divergence on top of a derived whole.
//
// Two things are deliberately NOT derived:
//
//   • `vishraam` — reading marks whose meaning does not change with the theme.
//     They stay on the fixed pair from the base unless a theme moves them, and
//     the only reason to move them is legibility on an unusual ground.
//   • `border.width` — a frame is a design decision, not a colour. Themes get
//     `border.color` for free but draw nothing until they ask for a width.

// The optional primitives, filled in when a theme does not supply them.
//
// `muted` lands 35% of the way from the ink toward the ground: far enough to
// read as secondary, close enough to stay comfortably above AA.
// `rule` is a translucent ink, so it sits correctly on the page whatever the
// ground is, including over a background texture.

// reads as broken. The keys are the app's own semantic ROLE names (see
// AUDIO_ROLES in bases/appBase.js), so the result merges straight over
// `theme.c` and every existing style rule in those components keeps working.
//
// One difference from the app's audio chrome: there, the control bar is a

// own rule instead of by a colour slab — which is what makes the player read as
// part of the reading surface rather than furniture parked on top of it.
