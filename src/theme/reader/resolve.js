// from it: which APPEARANCE to wear, and which READING theme to render Bani in.
//
// There is one setting — `state.theme` — and it holds either an appearance
// keyword ("Default" | "Light" | "Dark") or a designed theme's id ("blue",
// "puratan", …). A designed theme carries its own appearance in `base`, so
// choosing Blue puts the whole app in dark and the Reader in Blue; choosing
// Puratan puts the app in light and the Reader on parchment. That pairing is
// declared once, in the theme record, and nothing else has to know about it.
