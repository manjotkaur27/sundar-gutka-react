// Turns the static design tokens into the values actually used at render time,
// given the device's screen width and the user's OS text-size setting.
//
// This is why the token files hold plain numbers: those numbers are the design
// INTENT at a reference device (a regular-width phone at system font scale 1).
// Nothing renders them directly. `useTokens()` runs them through here first, so
// a component never contains a hardcoded measurement and never needs to know
// what device it is on.
//
// ── What scales, and why it differs ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// TYPE does not scale here. React Native scales `fontSize` AND `lineHeight`
// itself when `allowFontScaling` is on, which is the platform-native path and
// the one screen readers and OS accessibility settings expect. Pre-scaling here
// as well would apply the user's setting twice. The `Text` primitive caps it
// with `maxFontSizeMultiplier` instead.
//
// SPACING scales at a damped rate. Padding that grows in full lockstep with
// text produces cavernous gaps at large font settings — the text gets bigger
// and the room to put it shrinks. Half the delta keeps the rhythm proportional
// without eating the screen.
//
// CONTAINER MINIMUMS scale at the full rate, because their whole job is to
// still contain the text after it grows.
