// Screen-scoped palettes.
//
// These are the colours the Dashboard, Seva and the bani list carried before the
// token migration, restored deliberately. They are NOT part of the semantic
// layer and must not be used anywhere else: `semanticColors.js` still owns the
// roles every other screen reads, and mixing the two is what produced the
// mismatch these replace.
//
// ── Why a separate file rather than more roles ─────────────────────────────
// A semantic role answers "what is this colour FOR" and must hold for every
// screen. These do not: the Dashboard's navy card and Seva's bordered amount
// pill are decisions about two specific screens, and folding them into
// `semanticColors` would either bloat it with screen-specific names or, worse,
// tempt a third screen into reading them.
//
// ── Shaped for the theme system that is coming ────────────────────────────
// Every palette is `{ light, dark }` with identical keys, exactly like a theme.
// When user-selectable themes land, a theme supplies its own object with these
// same keys and nothing else changes — the screens already read by key rather
// than by literal. `paletteFor` is the single resolution point, so a theme id
// can be threaded through it later without touching a call site.
