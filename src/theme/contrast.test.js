/**
 * A DELIBERATE, CLIENT-CHOSEN EXCEPTION — not a rule being quietly relaxed.
 *
 * Dark mode's blue is #3B82F6, specified by the client. As TEXT it measures:
 *
 *   background / backgroundAlt   5.01:1   passes
 *   surface                      4.54:1   passes
 *   surfaceElevated              4.01:1   UNDER the 4.5 floor
 *   surfaceSelected              3.39:1   UNDER the 4.5 floor
 *
 * So blue TEXT on a sheet or on a selected row falls short. It still clears
 * 3:1, so it is fine for icons, borders and other non-text marks, and it is
 * fine as a FILL — near-black on it is 5.01:1, which is how every filled
 * control here is drawn.
 *
 * Listing the pairs explicitly means the rule still runs everywhere else, and
 * changing either surface re-triggers this review instead of silently making
 * it worse. #60A5FA — the same hue one step lighter — clears every surface
 * (4.91:1 at worst) if strict AA is wanted for blue text later.
