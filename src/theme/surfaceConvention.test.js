// screen people spend the most time in a step lighter than everything else in
// dark mode. The audio boxes drifted the other way onto `surfaceElevated`, a
// third grey that matched nothing.
//
// Asserted as EQUALITY between roles rather than against hex values, so retuning
// the ladder cannot make this pass while the screens disagree.
