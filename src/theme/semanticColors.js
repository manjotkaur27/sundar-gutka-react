// TIER 2 — semantic roles. What a colour is FOR, not what it looks like.
//
// This is the layer components consume. A call site asks for `textSecondary`
// and gets something readable in whichever theme is active; it never branches
// on `isDark` itself. Every `isDark ? a : b` ternary left in a component is a
// missing role in this file and should be fixed here, not there.
//
// ── Colour budget (60/30/10) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//   60%  ground      — `background`, `surface`. Neutral. The screen itself.
//   30%  content     — text, borders, elevated surfaces. Also neutral.
//   10%  accent      — `accent`, `link`, `primary`, status. The only saturated
//                      colour on screen, reserved for what the user can act on
//                      or must notice.
// Blue is deliberately confined to that last 10%. Dark mode uses neutral greys
// for every surface; the blue-ground theme ships later as a user choice, and
// slots in as another entry in this file rather than a rewrite.
//
// ── Adding a theme later ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A user-selectable theme is a new object with these same keys. Because
// components only ever read role names, a theme cannot break a layout — the
// worst it can do is look wrong, and `contrast.test.js` runs over every
// registered theme, so it cannot even do that silently.
