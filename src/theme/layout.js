// TIER 3 — component dimensions. The heights and paddings that must be
// identical everywhere, resolved once.
//
// This exists because the same measurement is currently re-invented per screen:
// the Settings header, the Reader header, the Seva header and the Dashboard
// header are four different heights with four different paddings, and the row
// heights under them do not agree either. A screen should not get to have an
// opinion about how tall a header is.
//
// Deliberately platform-neutral. The app must look identical on iOS and
// Android, so nothing here branches on `Platform` — the only platform-specific
// values live in safe-area insets, which the OS supplies and which are added on
// top of these, never baked into them.
//
// Everything below is a MINIMUM where content can grow (`minHeight`), not a
// fixed height. A fixed height on anything text-bearing breaks the moment a
// translation runs long or the user raises their font size.
