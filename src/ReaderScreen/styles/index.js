// A NOTE ON `elevation` IN THIS FILE
//
// Some of these set `elevation` for STACKING, not for depth. On Android zIndex
// alone does not reliably order sibling views -- the platform sorts by
// elevation -- so both are set together. Android only casts a shadow from
// elevation when the view has a background, so a stacking-only layer with no
// background costs nothing and needs no iOS counterpart.
//
// Where a layer DOES have a background, the Android shadow is real and iOS must
// be given a matching one, or the same screen has depth on one platform and not
// the other. Those cases take the shared elevation preset and then restate
// `elevation` at the value the stacking order requires.
