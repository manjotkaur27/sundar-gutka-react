//
//   drain(op)   — send ONE queued outbox op and say what happened to it
//   reconcile() — bulk two-way sync: push what is pending, take back the merged
//                 truth from the account
//
// The outbox drainer calls `drain`; the dashboard's own sync (sign-in,
// foreground, connectivity returning, pull-to-refresh) calls `syncAll`, so
// every feature reconciles at the same moments the dashboard does and nothing
// needs its own timers or triggers.
