// because the app used to compute this locally with the `nanakshahi` package,
// which implements the ORIGINAL 2003 calendar: it begins Bhadon on 16 August
// where SGPC begins it on the 17th, so the header read one day ahead of the
// gurpurab dates sitting directly beneath it. One source now answers both, and
// a correction upstream reaches users without an app release.
//
// Resolution is: today's cache -> our backend -> the bundled table below.

//
// These are NOT stable year to year — SGPC reckons the months sidereally, so
// the starts drift a day: Magh began 13 Jan in 2026 and begins 14 Jan in 2027.
// The NS 558 values are used, matching the gurpurab table, and like it they
// want refreshing once the next Samat is published. Being a day out in the
// offline fallback is a far smaller thing than the card being blank, which is
// why this exists at all.
