 * ── Why this is mounted globally ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * It used to live in DashboardScreen, so both halves only existed while that
 * screen was mounted. Sign in from Settings, read banis, never open the
 * Dashboard, and nothing was ever pushed — the account's cloud snapshot stayed
 * empty, and the next device therefore had nothing to restore. That is the
 * "it doesn't sync on a different account" report. It now runs from
 * GlobalServices, above the navigator, and uses no navigation API.
 *
 * ── Two kinds of pull ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * BOOTSTRAP  once per account per device. Local is empty (a fresh install, or
 *            an account switch that just purged), so the snapshot is applied
 *            wholesale — preferences included.
 * REFRESH    every time after that. Only completion history and analytics, and
 *            merged rather than overwritten, so a pull can never destroy work
 *            this device has done but not yet pushed. Skipped outright when the
 *            server's `syncedAt` is no newer than what we last applied.
 *
 * ── The gate, and the bug it used to cause ─────────────────────────────────
 * A push before the bootstrap has settled would overwrite real cloud history
 * with a fresh install's near-zero totals, so RESTORED_KEY gates pushing. The
 * old code wrote that marker only on the success path and had no retry, so ONE
 * failed request — a tunnel, a flaky connection during sign-in — left it unset
 * and blocked every push for the rest of the process. The marker is now written
 * for any AUTHORITATIVE answer (a snapshot, or a 404 saying there is none), and
 * a failure schedules a retry instead of giving up until the next launch.

  // copy down, merge history (additive, so nothing can be lost either way),
  // decide preferences by whichever side changed last, and only then push the
  // reconciled result — so what goes up is the union of both devices rather
