/**
 * A cheap content fingerprint of a snapshot, used to skip pushes that would

 * the last one — the user opened the app, looked at the Dashboard and left. At
 * 16k users those are the bulk of all writes, and each one costs a full JSONB
 * row rewrite plus the dead tuple behind it.
 *
 * Hashes the PAYLOAD only, never the envelope: `capturedAt` is a fresh
 * timestamp on every build, so including it would make every snapshot unique
 * and the check useless.
 *
 * FNV-1a — not cryptographic, and does not need to be. A collision means one
 * push is skipped; the next real change has a different hash and goes up, and
 * the day's row is overwritten wholesale anyway.

 * account's real history with nothing, which is exactly what happened: a
 * mayankmonu snapshot went from 1122 seconds and a 2-day streak to
 * `{"readingSeconds":0,...}` with `month.days: []`.
 *
 * Used as a hard refusal in the push path. The asymmetry is what justifies it —
 * declining to upload an empty snapshot costs a genuinely-empty account nothing
