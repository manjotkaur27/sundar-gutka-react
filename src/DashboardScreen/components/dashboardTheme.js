// The Dashboard's palette, now sourced entirely from the app's token layer.
//
// This file used to be the app's THIRD design system: it carried its own
// contrast-pinned navy ramp because `theme.colors` could not express what the
// Dashboard needed. Those tints were the most thought-through colours in the
// repo, so the token layer's `navy` ramp was generated to match them — and
// `BRAND` is now an alias onto it rather than sixteen separate literals.
//
// Two of the old steps are deliberately NOT mapped to their nearest neighbour:
//
//   tint40 was a control border, held to 3:1. The nearest ramp step (navy 400)
//   measures 2.99:1 on the light alt ground — just under. It maps to navy 500.
//
//   tint45 was used for placeholder and secondary TEXT at roughly 3.0:1 on
//   white, which never met the 4.5:1 that text requires. It also maps to
//   navy 500 (5.37:1 on white), so the mapping fixes a real contrast failure
//   rather than preserving it.
//
// New code should read semantic roles from `useTokens()` instead of BRAND.
