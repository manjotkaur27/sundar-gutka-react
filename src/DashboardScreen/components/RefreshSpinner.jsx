/**
 * Refresh glyph that spins while a refetch is in flight.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an ActivityIndicator: that maps to a native widget whose
 * Android behaviour is unreliable — one mounted as animating={false} stays
 * hidden even after the prop flips (facebook/react-native#9023), and there are
 * device reports of it not drawing at all. Rotating the icon we already show is
 * also the clearer affordance, since the control keeps its identity instead of
 * being swapped for an unrelated shape.
 *
 * The rotation is a transform, so it runs on the native driver — identical on
 * iOS and Android, on the UI thread, and it costs no re-renders while looping.
