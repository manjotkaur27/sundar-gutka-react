/**
 * Write the reminder schedule to the OS, and tell the user if the OS refused.
 *
 * Every screen that changes reminders should call THIS rather than
 * `updateReminders` directly. On Android 12+ the exact-alarm permission is not
 * granted on install, and without it `createTriggerNotification` schedules
 * nothing and throws nothing — so the app happily showed reminders as "on"
 * while the system had none registered at all. Routing every caller through one
 * function means a new screen cannot reintroduce that silence by forgetting to
 * check.
 *
 * The prompt is a normal confirm, not a hard block: the user may genuinely want
 * to say no, and everything else about the screen still works if they do.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{scheduled: number, blocked: boolean}>}
