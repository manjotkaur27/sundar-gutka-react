// The offline-error noise was "fixed" once, in the Database Update SCREEN, while
// the home screen's own copy of the same check kept filing
// "useDatabaseUpdateCheck Network request failed" on every launch without a
// connection — and a dozen other fetch-and-fall-back paths had never been
// looked at at all. Fixing them one Crashlytics issue at a time is how that
// happens twice.
//
// So the rule is mechanical: a module that FETCHES must not report a failure
// with `logError`. It uses `logNetworkError`, which downgrades a connection
// problem to a breadcrumb and records everything else exactly as before.
//
// EXEMPT lists the places where a `logError` beside a fetch is reporting
// something that is not the request failing. Each one needs a reason.
