// Keeps on-device data belonging to the account that is actually signed in.
//
// Signing out used to clear only the Keychain token and the `auth` slice, so
// everything that makes up "your dashboard" — SQLite sessions, streaks,
// bookmarks, nitnem, layout, reminders — survived into the next person's
// session. Signing in as B showed A's reading history: wrong, and a privacy leak
// rather than merely a stale-cache bug.
//
// The first fix for that was to DELETE the history on every account change,
// including a plain sign-out. That is what made a much worse bug possible: sign
// out, read for a few minutes, sign back in, and the device held a near-empty
// store which the sync layer then treated as the account's truth and pushed
// over real history. An account lost a streak and every completed bani that way.
//
// So the HISTORY is no longer deleted — it is SCOPED. Each account has its own
// SQLite file (see database/analytics/accountDb), signing out detaches instead
// of destroying, and signing back in finds everything still there, including
// whatever had not been pushed yet. Account B never opens account A's file, so
// the privacy property survives without deleting anything.
//
// PREFERENCES — layout, reminders, nitnem, bookmarks — are still reset on an
// account CHANGE. They are small, single-valued and restored from the account's
// own snapshot, so resetting them costs nothing and keeps the boundary simple.
// They persist under one redux-persist key, which is why they are not scoped the
// same way.
