// A link is opened in the app that owns it when that app is installed — an
// Instagram profile in Instagram, a channel in YouTube — and in the in-app
// browser otherwise. Nothing here names a service, so a link the backend adds
// tomorrow gets the same treatment with no app release:
//
//   Android  every https link is offered to the system with
//            FLAG_ACTIVITY_REQUIRE_NON_BROWSER (see AppLauncherModule); the OS
//            opens the owning app or refuses, and a refusal means the browser.
//   iOS      has no such flag. The only installed-check is `canOpenURL` on the
//            app's URL scheme, and iOS only answers for schemes declared in
//            Info.plist (LSApplicationQueriesSchemes) at build time. So the
//            scheme is DERIVED from the link's own domain — instagram.com asks
//            for instagram://, substack.com for substack:// — and the plist
//            ships a broad list of them once. A domain whose scheme is not
//            declared, or does not follow its name, simply reads as "not
//            installed" and takes the in-app browser as before.
//
// The link itself is always opened as its https URL — a universal link on
// iOS, an app link on Android — so the app decides where it lands and nothing
// here needs each service's private URL grammar.

// Domains whose app scheme is not their own name.
