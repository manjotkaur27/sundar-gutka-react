// `folders` is exactly what `PUT /folders` accepts and `GET /folders` returns,
// so syncing is a straight serialise with no translation layer to drift. The

//   { id, name, source, items[], createdAt, updatedAt, isPublic?, pinned? }
//
// Order is the ARRAY order — the server preserves it — so there is no separate
// order list that could disagree with the folders it indexes. Pinning is a
// per-folder boolean for the same reason: it is the server's field, and a
// parallel array of pinned ids would be a second source of truth.
