// How every bottom sheet in the app moves: it slides up to open, can be dragged
// down to close the way Instagram's comment sheet can, and slides back down to
// close however it was closed — a drag, a tap outside, back, or Cancel.
//
// ── One value ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The panel's offset below its resting place is ONE shared value, and opening,
// dragging and closing all move that same value. Closing is one animation
// whatever asked for it, so a tap outside leaves exactly as smoothly as a drag
// does. It used to be two: a drag slid the panel its own height and thinned
// the scrim with it, while every other close shot it 700px in 110ms under a
// scrim that stayed at full strength and then vanished in one frame.
//
// It runs on the UI thread (Reanimated shared values under a gesture-handler
// pan), so the panel keeps up with the finger on the low end of the supported
// range too — a JS-driven drag stutters exactly there.
//
// ── Opening ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The scrim is there at full strength from the first frame — it is what says
// the tap landed — and the panel slides up over it.
//
// The slide starts on the Modal's `onShow`, never from an effect. A Modal is a
// separate native window whose children are not attached when the commit that
// renders it runs its effects; an animation started there targets a view that
// does not exist yet, and the sheet stays below the screen under a scrim with
// no way out but tapping it. `onShow` is React Native's documented "the modal
// is now on screen" callback — on Android it comes straight from the Dialog's
// own `setOnShowListener` (ReactModalHostManager.addEventEmitters).
//
// ── Dragging and closing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The panel follows the finger 1:1 downwards and not at all upwards, and the
// scrim thins in step with how far it has travelled, so the screen behind
// reads as coming back. Let go past a distance or with a flick and the sheet
// leaves; short of both, it springs home. Leaving slides it exactly its own
// height, the scrim thinning with it, and only then does the sheet unmount.
//
// ── Where a drag may start ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Anywhere a downward drag cannot mean anything else:
//   • the grab zone at the top — the bar itself, the title, a fixed header;
//   • a scrolling body, but only while it sits at its very top. Scrolled down,
//     a downward drag scrolls the list back, as it always did.
// Never on a control that owns vertical movement of its own — a picker wheel,
// a reorderable list — which is why a sheet that cannot vouch for its body
// offers the grab zone alone.
//
// Activation is decided by hand (`manualActivation`) from where the touch
// started and which way it is going, so a tap never activates the pan: every
// button, row and key inside the sheet still takes its press exactly as before.
//
// ── Inside a Modal ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every sheet is a React Native Modal, which on Android is its own window,
// outside the app's gesture-handler root — so no gesture fires there unless
// the Modal's content has a root of its own (react-native-gesture-handler,
// "Usage with modals"). `SheetGestureRoot` is that root. A root nested inside
// another enabled one switches itself off (RNGestureHandlerRootView:
// `rootViewEnabled = !hasGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(this)`), so a sheet
// whose content already carries one keeps working unchanged.
