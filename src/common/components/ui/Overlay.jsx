// The ONE place the app configures a modal window.
//
// Every overlay — sheets, dialogs, the day detail, the label prompt — renders
// through this. A lint rule forbids `<Modal>` anywhere else, because the window
// configuration is not a per-screen decision and getting it wrong is invisible
// until it is on a device:
//
// **Both translucency flags, always.** Under Android's edge-to-edge enforcement
// a Modal only spans the whole display when `statusBarTranslucent` AND
// `navigationBarTranslucent` are set. With the status-bar flag alone the window
// stops above the navigation bar and the scrim leaves an undimmed strip; worse,
// the window is inset while `useWindowDimensions` still reports the full
// display, so anything measured against the screen overflows its own window.
// Six of the app's eight modals were missing the navigation flag.
//
// **`onShow` and `onDismiss` are forwarded.** `onShow` so an entrance animation
// can start when the window actually exists. A Modal is a separate native window and its children are not
// attached during the commit that renders it, so a native-driven animation
// started in an effect targets a view that is not there yet and is silently
// dropped — the sheet then never leaves its off-screen start position and all
// the user sees is the scrim.
//
// `transparent` is not a prop: an overlay that is not transparent cannot show a
// scrim, and every overlay in this app has one.
