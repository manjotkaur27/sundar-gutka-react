 * is NOT granted on install — the user has to turn "Alarms & reminders" on
 * themselves. Until they do, `createTriggerNotification` does not schedule
 * anything and does not throw, so every reminder silently never fires.
 *
 * That was the bug: `dumpsys alarm` showed ZERO alarms registered for the app
 * while reminders appeared switched on in Settings.
 *
 * iOS has no equivalent — a scheduled UNNotificationRequest needs only the
 * notification permission — so this is true there and the caller carries on.

 *
 *  2. With that removed, `notifee.requestPermission()` then hung on its own.
 *     It does not resolve on Android 13+ when the permission is ALREADY
 *     granted (invertase/notifee#609, #1237), which is the normal case for any
 *     returning user. `getNotificationSettings()` is a plain read and always
 *     resolves, so the prompt is now reached only when genuinely needed.
 *

 * line after this call never did, first stopping at (1) and then at (2).
 * Turning reminders OFF always worked because that path returns before here.

// settles until the app next comes to the foreground — so the tap did nothing,
// and the answer (still denied) arrived on the next focus, which is when the
// "permission required" dialog appeared out of nowhere. Two guards:
//
//   - the prompt is requested at most once per app session; every later check
//     is the plain read, which is all that is needed to see a grant made in
