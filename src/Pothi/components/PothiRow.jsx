// Styled as a LIST ROW, not a card — the same shape the bani list uses: flat on
// the page's own ground, an inset hairline between rows, a folder glyph, and
// room to breathe (`space.lg` vertically, `layout.row.minHeight` as a floor).
//
// The row NAVIGATES; it does not expand. An accordion put a second, differently
// styled list inside the first one, which is why the contents read as a foreign
// block wedged into the page. Its banis now open on their own screen, in the
// ordinary All Banis list, where a bani behaves exactly as it does anywhere
// else — see FolderScreen.
//
// Sundar Gutka's bundled folders come through here too, with `system` set. They
// read identically but withhold pin and reorder, because they can be read and
// not edited.
//
// The add-to-pothi picker renders this row as well, with its own trailing
// control and label — a pothi should look the same wherever it is listed, and
// the picker having its own row is what left it a different height with a
// different glyph and a different divider.
