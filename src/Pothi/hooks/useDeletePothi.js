 * styling and the gate cannot drift apart between them.
 *
 * The pothi is named in the question rather than described in a second line of
 * body text: "Delete Nitnem pothi?" already says which one and what happens, and
 * a dialog with a title alone is one line to read instead of three.

 * @returns {(pothi: {id: string, name: string, count: number}, onDeleted?: Function) => void}
